                    <p>The Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the music of the piano. The Society follows the traditions established by the founders of the <a href="https://www.steinway.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinway & Sons Piano Company</a>, of providing a showcase for pianists and other musicians to meet and perform for the public and each other. The society is committed to providing performance opportunities for young pianists and a performance series dedicated to nationally and internationally recognized artists.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In the earliest years of Steinway & Sons, the development of the piano was still in its infancy. The modern piano, in fact, had yet to be invented. There were few cultural activities involving the piano - even in New York! The Steinway family would gather their friends for an intimate evening of piano music, and offer support to those striving to learn this amazing new instrument.</p>

                    <p>It is with this tradition that, in 1987, the Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania presented the first season. We are a growing organization, welcoming pianists and all piano music aficionados throughout the Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia areas. We welcome you to attend any of our performances, and invite you to become a member of The Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania.</p>
