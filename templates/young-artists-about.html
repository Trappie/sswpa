                    <p>Students audition for the Young Artist Program in the spring of each year. All students auditioning are accepted into our program and will have the opportunity to perform in Honors Recitals, where they will receive a plaque and a certificate of recognition, as well as in Master Classes.</p>

                    <p>A number of auditioning students will be selected to perform a short recital at the Heinz Hall Lobby, often before Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts featuring a piano concerto.</p>

                    <p>Each Young Artist's family is entitled to 4 free tickets to each of the recitals on the Artist Recital Series. Attendance at performances featuring professional pianists is an excellent enhancement to the student's overall musical education. Therefore, we expect all Young Artists to attend at least two recitals.</p>

                    <p>In 2021, an Outstanding Artist Award was created, courtesy of the Melanie Schmidt Memorial Fund. This $200 award will be given to one auditioning student only, chosen by the adjudicator.</p>
