                    <p>The Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania presents two programs each season: the Artist Recital Series and the Young Artist program, providing opportunities for the young pianists of the region.</p>

                    <h2>Artist Recital Series</h2>
                    <p>The Artist Recital Series strives to promote the piano by presenting nationally and internationally acclaimed artists of the highest caliber in solo recital for the Pittsburgh audience. All recitals take place on Sundays at 3pm in Kresge Theatre at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Fine Arts (<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=Kresge+Theatre+Carnegie+Mellon+University+College+of+Fine+Arts+Pittsburgh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view location</a>). After each recital, there is a "Meet the Artist" reception.</p>

                    <h2>Steinway Young Artist Program</h2>
                    <p>The Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania holds auditions each spring for students of piano teachers who are SSWPA members. Accomplished pre-college piano students who can perform memorized pieces from the standard piano repertoire are encouraged to participate. Qualified students will have the opportunity to perform in recitals in the Heinz Hall lobby preceding Pittsburgh Symphony subscription concerts, as well as in master classes with renowned pianists.</p>
